In this project, we delve into the realm of data analytics to craft a powerful PowerBI dashboard that illuminates crucial facets of customer retention for a telecommunications company. Through meticulous analysis and visualization, we've brought to light pivotal information that forms the bedrock of strategic decision-making.

The dashboard elegantly presents key metrics. The revenue figure stands at a notable 16.06 million, underscoring the company's financial standing. Customer churn, a pivotal concern, is dissected by gender â€“ 3.6K males and 3.5K females. This gender-wise breakdown empowers targeted retention approaches.

Payment methods hold immense significance. The dashboard spotlights the distribution across 1.61K mailed check users, 1.54K bank transfers, 2.37K electronic check users, and 1.52K credit card users. Such insights illuminate preferred transaction modes, essential for tailored strategies.

The pivotal churn rate is impressively visualized at 26.54%. This vital metric serves as a compass for customer retention efforts. Additionally, tenure months and contract types are seamlessly presented. The dashboard encapsulates the distribution across 3.88K month-to-month contracts, 1.70K two-year contracts, and 1.47K one-year contracts, providing a granular view of customer commitment.

The underlying force of data and business analytics is harnessed to craft a dashboard that not only presents raw data but also distills it into actionable insights. As the company seeks to bolster its customer retention endeavors, this PowerBI dashboard becomes a guiding light, steering strategies and initiatives toward heightened customer satisfaction and prolonged engagement.
